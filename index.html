For example, a person with a learning disability may have difficulty accessing education and may require specialized support in order to succeed in school. A person with mental illness may struggle with stigma and discrimination, and may have difficulty finding and maintaining employment. A person with chronic pain may face barriers to accessing healthcare and may require accommodations in order to participate fully in daily activities. Overall, non-visible disabilities can present a range of complex challenges that can affect every aspect of a person's life.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Bringing Awareness to disability does not just mean finding care and accessibility to certain people, it also means bringing awareness to general information about how these people can still live a fulfilling life even when they are disadvantaged either physically or mentally. Unlearning stereotypical ideas and thoughts about the disabled is also a form of raising awareness. When talking about this community people need to be more sensitive and understanding of what the disabled go through and how they are still able to overcome their shortcomings to follow their hobbies, passions and interests of their liking.</p>

This can include providing extra time for tests, providing alternative seating arrangements, or providing access to assistive technology. These accommodations can help to ensure that students with disabilities are able to participate in the classroom and have the same opportunities as their peers. It is also important to recognize the importance of providing support for those with disabilities. This can include providing a safe space for students to talk about their experiences, providing resources for students to access, and providing support for students to help them cope with their disability that might not be apparent to the naked eye. This can help to ensure that students with disabilities are able to feel comfortable and included in the classroom. We also must recognize the importance of providing resources for those with disabilities. This can include providing access to support groups, providing access to counseling services, and providing access to assistive technology. These resources can help to ensure that students with disabilities are able to access the support they need to succeed in the classroom. Overall, it is ideal to recognize the disabilities in society that one may not be able to see on its own. This can help to ensure that students with disabilities are able to feel comfortable and included in the classroom, and that they are able to access the resources they need to succeed. By recognizing these disabilities, we can help to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">When it comes to disabilities within people, especially disabilities that cannot be seen with the naked eye, people often forget to think about how it makes the person feel. The only thing people tend to think about is how a disability can make someone “different” and how it can make their life more difficult to live. The way a disability can not only affect someone directly, but also affect them by damaging their self esteem is often overlooked. Many people with these kinds of disabilities often struggle socially even if the disability they have has no effect on their social skills. The reason they struggle socially is solely because of the fact that they are super insecure and self conscious because they know they have a disability, even though the disability itself has no effect on their social abilities. These struggles may lead to depression, anxiety, and other problems within those with these kinds of disabilities, and makes their lives harder than it has to be. Luckily, companies like ARISE Impact is on a mission to create opportunities and form modules so that people with disabilities can establish their confidence and develop new learning tactics. If you want to make a difference, you can contact ARISE Impact at contact@ariseimpact.org, or you can visit their website at http://www.ariseimpact.org/ to learn more!</p>

There are many potential methods that the IDA could employ to help people with these disabilities, and the specific methods used may vary depending on the individual needs and circumstances of each person. Some potential methods that the IDA might use to help people with invisible disabilities could include:

Providing educational resources and information about invisible disabilities, such as information about different types of invisible disabilities, common challenges and symptoms, and coping strategies.

Connecting people with invisible disabilities with support groups and peer networks, so that they can share their experiences and offer each other support and guidance.

Advocating for the rights and needs of people with invisible disabilities, such as working to improve accessibility and inclusion in schools, workplaces, and public spaces.

Raising awareness about invisible disabilities and promoting understanding and acceptance among the general public.

Offering financial assistance, such as grants or scholarships, to help people with invisible disabilities access the support and resources they need.

Overall, the methods used by the IDA to help people with invisible disabilities may be diverse and varied, but they will likely be focused on providing education, support, and advocacy to help people with these conditions live fulfilling and independent lives.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">People with non-visible disabilities, such as chronic illnesses or mental health conditions, may face unique challenges in their daily lives. However, there are also a number of efforts underway to help these individuals. For example, many organizations and advocacy groups are working to raise awareness about non-visible disabilities and to promote understanding and inclusion. In addition, there are a number of laws and policies in place that aim to protect the rights of people with non-visible disabilities and to ensure that they have access to the same opportunities as everyone else. This can include things like the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which ensures that students with disabilities have access to a free and appropriate education. In addition to the efforts being made by organizations and advocacy groups, there are also things that individuals can do to help people with non-visible disabilities. One of the most important things is to be understanding and accepting of individuals with non-visible disabilities. This can include being patient and supportive, and not judging or making assumptions about a person's abilities based on their appearance. In addition, it can be helpful to educate yourself about non-visible disabilities and the challenges that people with these conditions may face. This can help you to be more aware and sensitive to the needs of people with non-visible disabilities. Finally, you can also support organizations that work to help people with non-visible disabilities, either through donations or by volunteering your time and talents.</p>
